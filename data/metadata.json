        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is the Natural Language Processing (NLP) task dealing with\nthe detection and classification of sentiments in texts. While some tasks deal\nwith identifying the presence of sentiment in the text (Subjectivity analysis),\nother tasks aim at determining the polarity of the text categorizing them as\npositive, negative and neutral. Whenever there is a presence of sentiment in\nthe text, it has a source (people, group of people or any entity) and the\nsentiment is directed towards some entity, object, event or person. Sentiment\nanalysis tasks aim to determine the subject, the target and the polarity or\nvalence of the sentiment. In our work, we try to automatically extract\nsentiment (positive or negative) from Facebook posts using a machine learning\napproach.While some works have been done in code-mixed social media data and in\nsentiment analysis separately, our work is the first attempt (as of now) which\naims at performing sentiment analysis of code-mixed social media text. We have\nused extensive pre-processing to remove noise from raw text. Multilayer\nPerceptron model has been used to determine the polarity of the sentiment. We\nhave also developed the corpus for this task by manually labeling Facebook\nposts with their associated sentiments.",

This\nproject introduces an approach using unsupervised learning techniques,\nparticularly Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering, to analyze sentiment. AP\nclustering groups text data based on natural patterns, without needing\npredefined cluster numbers. The paper compares AP with K-means clustering,\nusing TF-IDF Vectorization for text representation and Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. To enhance performance, AP is\ncombined with Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. This hybrid method refines\nclusters further, capturing both global and local sentiment structures more\neffectively. The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated using the\nSilhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Score, and Davies-Bouldin Index. Results\nshow that AP with Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering significantly\noutperforms K-means. This research contributes to Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) by proposing a scalable and efficient unsupervised learning framework for\nsentiment analysis, highlighting the significant societal impact of advanced AI\ntechniques in analyzing public sentiment without the need for extensive labeled\ndata.",

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained task in the\nfield of sentiment analysis, which aims to predict the polarity of aspects. The\nresearch of pre-training neural model has significantly improved the\nperformance of many natural language processing tasks. In recent years, pre\ntraining model (PTM) has been applied in ABSA.

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis becomes an essential part of every social network, as it\nenables decision-makers to know more about users' opinions in almost all life\naspects. Despite its importance, there are multiple issues it encounters like\nthe sentiment of the sarcastic text which is one of the main challenges of\nsentiment analysis. This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a novel\nsystem (SAIDS) that predicts the sentiment, sarcasm and dialect of Arabic\ntweets. SAIDS uses its prediction of sarcasm and dialect as known information\nto predict the sentiment. It uses MARBERT as a language model to generate\nsentence embedding, then passes it to the sarcasm and dialect models, and then\nthe outputs of the three models are concatenated and passed to the sentiment\nanalysis model. Multiple system design setups were experimented with and\nreported. SAIDS was applied to the ArSarcasm-v2 dataset where it outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art model for the sentiment analysis task. By training all\ntasks together, SAIDS achieves results of 75.98 FPN, 59.09 F1-score and 71.13\nF1-score for sentiment analysis, sarcasm detection, and dialect identification\nrespectively. The system design can be used to enhance the performance of any\ntask which is dependent on other tasks.",

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is a key technology for companies and institutions to\ngauge public opinion on products, services or events. However, for large-scale\nsentiment analysis to be accessible to entities with modest computational\nresources, it needs to be performed in a resource-efficient way. While some\nefficient sentiment analysis systems exist, they tend to apply shallow\nheuristics, which do not take into account syntactic phenomena that can\nradically change sentiment. Conversely, alternatives that take syntax into\naccount are computationally expensive. The SALSA project, funded by the\nEuropean Research Council under a Proof-of-Concept Grant, aims to leverage\nrecently-developed fast syntactic parsing techniques to build sentiment\nanalysis systems that are lightweight and efficient, while still providing\naccuracy and explainability through the explicit use of syntax.

        "abstract": "This research presents an advanced sentiment analysis framework studied on\nIranian restaurant reviews, combining fuzzy logic with conventional sentiment\nanalysis techniques to assess both sentiment polarity and intensity. A dataset\nof 1266 reviews, alongside corresponding star ratings, was compiled and\npreprocessed for analysis. Initial sentiment analysis was conducted using the\nSentiment Intensity Analyzer (VADER), a rule-based tool that assigns sentiment\nscores across positive, negative, and neutral categories. However, a noticeable\nbias toward neutrality often led to an inaccurate representation of sentiment\nintensity. To mitigate this issue, based on a fuzzy perspective, two refinement\ntechniques were introduced, applying square-root and fourth-root\ntransformations to amplify positive and negative sentiment scores while\nmaintaining neutrality. This led to three distinct methodologies: Approach 1,\nutilizing unaltered VADER scores; Approach 2, modifying sentiment values using\nthe square root; and Approach 3, applying the fourth root for further\nrefinement. A Fuzzy Inference System incorporating comprehensive fuzzy rules\nwas then developed to process these refined scores and generate a single,\ncontinuous sentiment value for each review based on each approach. Comparative\nanalysis, including human supervision and alignment with customer star ratings,\nrevealed that the refined approaches significantly improved sentiment analysis\nby reducing neutrality bias and better capturing sentiment intensity. Despite\nthese advancements, minor over-amplification and persistent neutrality in\ndomain-specific cases were identified, leading us to propose several future\nstudies to tackle these occasional barriers.

        "title": "Using Natural Language Processing to Explore Social Media Opinions on Food Security: Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling Study",
        "abstract": "Background Social media has the potential to be of great value in understanding patterns in public health using large-scale analysis approaches (eg, data science and natural language processing [NLP]), 2 of which have been used in public health: sentiment analysis and topic modeling; however, their use in the area of food security and public health nutrition is limited. Objective This study aims to explore the potential use of NLP tools to gather insights from real-world social media data on the public health issue of food security. Methods A search strategy for obtaining tweets was developed using food security terms. Tweets were collected using the Twitter application programming interface from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2021, filtered for Australia-based users only. Sentiment analysis of the tweets was performed using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner. Topic modeling exploring the content of tweets was conducted using latent Dirichlet allocation with BigML (BigML, Inc). Sentiment, topic, and engagement (the sum of likes, retweets, quotations, and replies) were compared across years. Results In total, 38,070 tweets were collected from 14,880 Twitter users. Overall, the sentiment when discussing food security was positive, although this varied across the 3 years. Positive sentiment remained higher during the COVID-19 lockdown periods in Australia. The topic model contained 10 topics (in order from highest to lowest probability in the data set): \u201cGlobal production,\u201d \u201cFood insecurity and health,\u201d \u201cUse of food banks,\u201d \u201cGiving to food banks,\u201d \u201cFamily poverty,\u201d \u201cFood relief provision,\u201d \u201cGlobal food insecurity,\u201d \u201cClimate change,\u201d \u201cAustralian food insecurity,\u201d and \u201cHuman rights.\u201d The topic \u201cGiving to food banks,\u201d which focused on support and donation, had the highest proportion of positive sentiment, and \u201cGlobal food insecurity,\u201d which covered food insecurity prevalence worldwide, had the highest proportion of negative sentiment. When compared with news, there were some events, such as COVID-19 support payment introduction and bushfires across Australia, that were associated with high periods of positive or negative sentiment. Topics related to food insecurity prevalence, poverty, and food relief in Australia were not consistently more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic. Negative tweets received substantially higher engagement across 2019 and 2020. There was no clear relationship between topics that were more likely to be positive or negative and have higher or lower engagement, indicating that the identified topics are discrete issues. Conclusions In this study, we demonstrated the potential use of sentiment analysis and topic modeling to explore evolution in conversations on food security using social media data. Future use of NLP in food security requires the context of and interpretation by public health experts and the use of broader data sets, with the potential to track dimensions or events related to food security to inform evidence-based decision-making in this area.",

        "abstract": "The metaverse has become one of the most popular concepts of recent times. Companies and entrepreneurs are fiercely competing to invest and take part in this virtual world. Millions of people globally are anticipated to spend much of their time in the metaverse, regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, or culture. There are few comprehensive studies on the positive/negative sentiment and effect of the newly identified, but not well defined, metaverse concept that is already fast evolving the digital landscape. Thereby, this study aimed to better understand the metaverse concept, by, firstly, identifying the positive and negative sentiment characteristics and, secondly, by revealing the associations between the metaverse concept and other related concepts. To do so, this study used Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI) with computational qualitative analysis. The data comprised metaverse articles from 2021 to 2022 published on The Guardian website, a key global mainstream media outlet. To perform thematic content analysis of the qualitative data, this research used the Leximancer software, and the The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) from NLP libraries were used to identify sentiment. Further, an AI-based Monkeylearn API was used to make sectoral classifications of the main topics that emerged in the Leximancer analysis. The key themes which emerged in the Leximancer analysis, included \"metaverse\", \"Facebook\", \"games\" and \"platforms\". The sentiment analysis revealed that of all articles published in the period of 2021\u20132022 about the metaverse, 61% (n\u2009=\u2009622) were positive, 30% (n\u2009=\u2009311) were negative, and 9% (n\u2009=\u200990) were neutral. Positive discourses about the metaverse were found to concern key innovations that the virtual experiences brought to users and companies with the support of the technological infrastructure of blockchain, algorithms, NFTs, led by the gaming world. Negative discourse was found to evidence various problems (misinformation, harmful content, algorithms, data, and equipment) that occur during the use of Facebook and other social media platforms, and that individuals encountered harm in the metaverse or that the metaverse produces new problems. Monkeylearn findings revealed \u201cmarketing/advertising/PR\u201d role, \u201cRecreational\u201d business, \u201cScience & Technology\u201d events as the key content topics. This study\u2019s contribution is twofold: first, it showcases a novel way to triangulate qualitative data analysis of large unstructured textual data as a method in exploring the metaverse concept; and second, the study reveals the characteristics of the metaverse as a concept, as well as its association with other related concepts. Given that the topic of the metaverse is new, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to do both.",

        "abstract": "Background Sarcopenia, defined as the age-associated loss of muscle mass and strength, can be effectively mitigated through resistance-based physical activity. With compliance at approximately 40% for home-based exercise prescriptions, implementing a remote sensing system would help patients and clinicians to better understand treatment progress and increase compliance. The inclusion of end users in the development of mobile apps for remote-sensing systems can ensure that they are both user friendly and facilitate compliance. With advancements in natural language processing (NLP), there is potential for these methods to be used with data collected through the user-centered design process. Objective This study aims to develop a mobile app for a novel device through a user-centered design process with both older adults and clinicians while exploring whether data collected through this process can be used in NLP and sentiment analysis Methods Through a user-centered design process, we conducted semistructured interviews during the development of a geriatric-friendly Bluetooth-connected resistance exercise band app. We interviewed patients and clinicians at weeks 0, 5, and 10 of the app development. Each semistructured interview consisted of heuristic evaluations, cognitive walkthroughs, and observations. We used the Bing sentiment library for a sentiment analysis of interview transcripts and then applied NLP-based latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify differences and similarities in patient and clinician participant interviews. Sentiment was defined as the sum of positive and negative words (each word with a +1 or \u22121 value). To assess utility, we used quantitative assessment questionnaires\u2014System Usability Scale (SUS) and Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of use (USE). Finally, we used multivariate linear models\u2014adjusting for age, sex, subject group (clinician vs patient), and development\u2014to explore the association between sentiment analysis and SUS and USE outcomes. Results The mean age of the 22 participants was 68 (SD 14) years, and 17 (77%) were female. The overall mean SUS and USE scores were 66.4 (SD 13.6) and 41.3 (SD 15.2), respectively. Both patients and clinicians provided valuable insights into the needs of older adults when designing and building an app. The mean positive-negative sentiment per sentence was 0.19 (SD 0.21) and 0.47 (SD 0.21) for patient and clinician interviews, respectively. We found a positive association with positive sentiment in an interview and SUS score (\u00df=1.38; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.39; P=.01). There was no significant association between sentiment and the USE score. The LDA analysis found no overlap between patients and clinicians in the 8 identified topics. Conclusions Involving patients and clinicians allowed us to design and build an app that is user friendly for older adults while supporting compliance. This is the first analysis using NLP and usability questionnaires in the quantification of user-centered design of technology for older adults.",

        "abstract": "Social Networking has become a platform for people to post their views and opinions about everything. People tend to mix their regional language with other languages that they are familiar with which gives rise to Mixed-Case Languages. These multilingual texts pose a great challenge to conventional Natural Language Processing systems, which currently rely greatly on monolingual resources and cannot handle the combination of multiple languages. The study of people's attitude, opinions, views and to classify them as positive, negative or neutral is called Sentiment Analysis. It is an extremely powerful tool in today's world since it allows businesses, restaurants, internet providers, airlines, etc to quickly detect dissatisfied customers, categorize issues with urgency and prioritize responses. The proposed system focuses on the sentiment analysis of a Hinglish (Hindi-English) text corpus. This paper discusses various approaches such as the Lexicon-Based, Rule-Based and Machine Learning approaches to study the effectiveness of the approach chosen for classifying the text corpus with their appropriate sentiment labels.

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis involves using computational methods to identify and classify opinions expressed in text, with the goal of determining whether the writer's stance towards a particular topic, product, or idea is positive, negative, or neutral. However, sentiment analysis in Arabic presents unique challenges due to the complexity of Arabic morphology and the variety of dialects, which make language classification even more difficult. To address these challenges, we conducted to investigation and overview the techniques used in the last five years for embedding and classification of Arabic sentiment analysis (ASA). We collected data from 100 publications, resulting in a representative dataset of 2,300 detailed records that included attributes related to the dataset, feature extraction, approach, parameters, and performance measures. Our study aimed to identify the most powerful approaches and best model settings by analyzing the collected data to identify the significant parameters influencing performance. The results showed that Deep Learning and Machine Learning were the most commonly used techniques, followed by lexicon and transformer-based techniques. However, Deep Learning models were found to be more accurate for sentiment classification than other Machine Learning models. Furthermore, multi-level embedding was found to be a significant step in improving model accuracy.",

Knowing that in WoS, a scientific paper is described by the group Paper = {Abstract, Keyword, Title}; we obtained via NLP methods the word dictionaries with their frequencies of use and the word cloud for the 100 most used words, and we investigated if there is a degree of similarity between the titles of the papers and their abstracts, respectively. Using the Python packages NLTK, TextBlob, VADER, we computed sentiment scores for paper titles and abstracts, analyzed the results, and then, using Azure Machine Learning-Sentiment analysis, extended the range of comparison of sentiment scores. Our proposed analysis method can be applied to any research topic or theme from papers, articles, or projects in various fields of specialization to create a minimal dictionary of terms based on frequency of use, with visual representation by word cloud.

The model was created specifically for Croatian and is based on unigrams, but it can be used with any language that supports the n-gram model and expanded to multiple word sequences. The presented model generates a sentiment score aligned with discrete and dimensional emotion models, reliability metrics, and individual word scores using affective datasets Extended ANEW and NRC WordEmotion Association Lexicon. The sentiment analysis model incorporates different methodologies, including lexicon-based, machine learning, and hybrid approaches. The process of preprocessing includes translation, lemmatization, and data refinement, utilized automated translation services as well as the CLARIN Knowledge Centre for South Slavic languages (CLASSLA) library, with a particular emphasis on diacritical mark correction and tokenization. The presented model was experimentally evaluated on three simultaneous major natural crises that recently affected Croatia. The study\u2019s findings reveal a significant shift in emotional dimensions during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly a decrease in valence, arousal, and dominance, which corresponded with the two-month recovery period. Furthermore, the 2020 Croatian earthquakes elicited a wide range of negative discrete emotions, including anger, fear, and sadness, with the recuperation period much longer than in the case of COVID-19. This study represents an advancement in sentiment analysis, particularly in linguistically specific contexts, and provides insights into the emotional landscape shaped by major societal events.",

In particular, social media has become a major source of storing people\u2019s sentiments in the form of opinions and views on specific issues in the form of unstructured information. Therefore, the importance of emotion analysis is increasing, especially with machine learning for both personal life and companies\u2019 management environments. At this time, data reliability is an essential component for data classification. The accuracy of sentiment classification can be heavily determined according to the reliability of data, in which case noise data may also influence this classification. Although there is stopword that does not have meaning in such noise data, data that does not fit the purpose of analysis can also be referred to as noise data. This paper aims to provide an analysis of the impact of profanity data on deep learning-based sentiment classification. For this purpose, we used movie review data on the Web and simulated the changes in performance before and after the removal of the profanity data. The accuracy of the model trained with the data and the model trained with the data before removal were compared to determine whether the profanity is noise data that lowers the accuracy in sentiment analysis. The simulation results show that the accuracy dropped by about 2% when judging profanity as noise data in the sentiment classification for review data.",

        "abstract": "Virtual users generate a gigantic volume of unbalanced sentiments over various online crowd-sourcing platforms which consist of text, emojis, or a combination of both. Its accurate analysis brings profits to various industries and their services. The state-of-art detects sentiment polarity using common sense with text only. The research work proposes an emoji-based framework for cognitive\u2013conceptual\u2013affective computing of sentiment polarity based on the linguistic patterns of text and emojis. The proposed emoji and text-based parser articulates sentiments with proposed linguistic features along with a combination of different emojis to generate the part of speech into n-gram patterns. In this paper, the sentiments of 650 world-famous personages consisting of 1,68,548 tweets have been downloaded from across the world. The results illustrate that the proposed natural language processing framework shows that the existence of emojis in sentiments many times seems to change the overall polarity of the sentiment. By extension, the CLDR name of the emoji is utilized to evaluate the accurate polarity of emoji patterns, and a dictionary of sentiments is adopted for evaluating the polarity of text. Eventually, the performances of three ML classifiers (SVM, DT, and Na\u00efve Bayes) are evaluated for proposed distinctive linguistic features. The robust experiments indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the SVM classifier as compared to other ML classifiers. The proposed polarity detection generator has achieved an exceptional perspective of sentiments presented in the sentence by employing the flow of concept established, based on linguistic features, polarity inversion, coordination, and discourse patterns, surpassing the performance of extant state-of-the-art approaches.",

This paper explores a novel implementation of sentiment analysis using the Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) framework. As ansatz choice determines model performance in VQA, this paper proposes an alternative ansatz for the sentiment classification task in quantum representation. Specifically, it builds upon previous work in quantum sentiment classification by proposing an alternative ansatz to the Instantaneous Quantum Polytime ansatz, entitled Simple Sentiment Analysis (SimpleSA) ansatz. A key feature of the SimpleSA ansatz is the decision to neglect noun parameterization. The proposed SimpleSA has less complexity than the other ans\u00e4tze in terms of the number of parameters and the number of gates. Moreover, experimental results show that the SimpleSA ansatz with H-CNOT-Rz-H compound block construction outperforms the Instantaneous Quantum Polytime (IQP) ansatz at 85.00% accuracy. Furthermore, SimpleSA optimization converges 20.89% faster than Instantaneous Quantum Polytime (IQP) for the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) method with 130 iterations.

Customers' preferences and choices are influenced by the opinions of others online; on blogs or social networks. New customers are faced with many views on the web, but they can't make the right decision. Hence, the need for sentiment analysis is to clarify whether opinions are positive, negative or neutral. This paper suggests using the Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis approach on reviews extracted from tourism websites such as TripAdvisor and Booking. This approach is based on two main steps namely aspect extraction and sentiment classification related to each aspect. For aspect extraction, an approach based on topic modeling is proposed using the semi-supervised CorEx (Correlation Explanation) method for labeling word sequences into entities. As for sentiment classification, various supervised machine learning techniques are used to associate a sentiment (positive, negative or neutral) to a given aspect expression. Experiments on opinion corpora have shown very encouraging performances.",

Document similarity may be used to gain some insight into the way parties change over time and which political parties are successful at bringing attention to their policy agenda. Categorizing text into topics may help objectively categorize and visualize the ideas political parties are discussing. Finally, sentiment analysis has the potential to show each political party\u2019s attitude towards a policy area/topic. This study specifically applies these techniques to the manifestos produced by the political parties of New Zealand, from 1987 to 2017 (a period of significant party system change in New Zealand).

        "abstract": "In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Sentiment Analysis (SA) is a fundamental process which predicts the sentiment expressed in sentences. In contrast to conventional sentiment analysis, Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) employs a more nuanced approach to assess the sentiment of individual aspects or components within a document or sentence. Its objective is to identify the sentiment polarity, such as positive, neutral, or negative, associated with particular elements disclosed within a sentence. This research introduces a novel sentiment analysis technique that proves to be more efficient in sentiment analysis compared to current methods. The suggested sentiment analysis method undergoes three key phases: 1. Pre-processing 2. Extraction of aspect sentiment and 3. Sentiment analysis classification. The input text data undergoes pre-processing through the implementation of four typical text normalization techniques, which include stemming, stop word elimination, lemmatization, and tokenization. By employing these methods, the provided text data is prepared and fed into the aspect sentiment extraction phase. During the aspect sentiment extraction phase, features are obtained through a series of steps, including enhanced ATE (Aspect Term Extraction), assessment of word length, and determination of cosine similarity. By following these steps, the relevant features are extracted on the basis of aspects and sentiments involved in the text data. Further, a hybrid classification model is proposed to classify sentiments. In this work, two of the Deep Learning (DL) classifiers, Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) and Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) are used in proposing a hybrid classification model which classifies the sentiments effectively and provides accurate final predicted results. Moreover, the performance of proposed sentiment analysis technique is analyzed experimentally to show its efficacy over other models.",

Investigating gender bias in the media is a useful tool for understanding socio-cultural barriers to implementing legislation for gender equality. Natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as word embedding and sentiment analysis, can efficiently quantify media biases at a scope previously unavailable in the social sciences. Methods: We trained GloVe and word2vec word embeddings on text from 1998 to 2019 from Kenya\u2019s Daily Nation newspaper. We measured gender bias in these embeddings and used sentiment analysis to predict quantitative sentiment scores for sentences surrounding female leader names compared to male leader names. Results: Bias in leadership words for men and women measured from Daily Nation word embeddings corresponded to temporal trends in men and women\u2019s participation in political leadership (i.e., parliamentary seats) using GloVe (correlation 0.8936, p = 0.0067, r2 = 0.799) and word2vec (correlation 0.844, p = 0.0169, r2 = 0.712) algorithms. Women continue to be associated with domestic terms while men continue to be associated with influence terms, for both regular gender words and female and male political leaders\u2019 names. Male words (e.g., he, him, man) were mentioned 1.84 million more times than female words from 1998 to 2019. Sentiment analysis showed an increase in relative negative sentiment associated with female leaders (p = 0.0152) and an increase in positive sentiment associated with male leaders over time (p = 0.0216). Conclusion: Natural language processing is a powerful method for gaining insights into and quantifying trends in gender biases and sentiment in news media. We found evidence of improvement in gender equality but also a backlash from increased female representation in high-level governmental leadership.",

        "title": "Toward Bias Analysis Using Tweets and Natural Language Processing",
        "abstract": "Whether intentionally or not, many individuals in society express some form of prejudice or bias in their thinking and communications. Prejudice can be expressed in a multitude of ways and may be directed towards anything in which people can have an opinion. What makes prejudiced/biased thinking different and potentially more dangerous than having an opinion is that they are not always based on one's personal experiences and therefore may be misinformed. With the rise of social media platforms in the last 20 years or so, people have more ways than ever to express their opinions and share their voices. This paper defines an approach to using Twitter, one of the most popular modern-day social media platforms, to analyze an individual's tweets for the purposes of identifying potential biases. Using sentiment analysis along with other natural language processing tools, a score of potential bias of an individual user is calculated. This score can provide insight to the degree and/or frequency at which a person can be expected to exhibit biased behavior or make biased statements and is only meant to serve as a reference.",

        "abstract": "Background Evaluating patients\u2019 experiences is essential when incorporating the patients\u2019 perspective in improving healthcare. Experiences are mainly collected using closed-ended questions, although the value of open-ended questions is widely recognized. Natural language processing (NLP) can automate the analysis of open-ended questions for an efficient approach to patient-centeredness. Methods We developed the Artificial Intelligence Patient-Reported Experience Measures (AI-PREM) tool, consisting of a new, open-ended questionnaire, an NLP pipeline to analyze the answers using sentiment analysis and topic modeling, and a visualization to guide physicians through the results. The questionnaire and NLP pipeline were iteratively developed and validated in a clinical context. Results The final AI-PREM consisted of five open-ended questions about the provided information, personal approach, collaboration between healthcare professionals, organization of care, and other experiences. The AI-PREM was sent to 867 vestibular schwannoma patients, 534 of which responded. The sentiment analysis model attained an F1 score of 0.97 for positive texts and 0.63 for negative texts. There was a 90% overlap between automatically and manually extracted topics. The visualization was hierarchically structured into three stages: the sentiment per question, the topics per sentiment and question, and the original patient responses per topic. Conclusions The AI-PREM tool is a comprehensive method that combines a validated, open-ended questionnaire with a well-performing NLP pipeline and visualization. Thematically organizing and quantifying patient feedback reduces the time invested by healthcare professionals to evaluate and prioritize patient experiences without being confined to the limited answer options of closed-ended questions.",

        "abstract": "Cyberspace is a vast soapbox for people to post anything that they witness in their day-to-day lives. Social media content is mostly used for review, opinion, influence, or sentiment analysis. In this paper, we aim to extend sentiment and emotion analysis for detecting the stress of an individual based on the posts and comments shared by him/her on social networking platforms. We leverage large-scale datasets with tweets to accomplish sentiment analysis with the aid of machine learning algorithms and a deep learning model, BERT for sentiment classification. We also adopted Latent Dirichlet Allocation which is an unsupervised machine learning method for scanning a group of documents, recognizing the word and phrase patterns within them, and gathering word groups and alike expressions that most precisely illustrate a set of documents. This helps us to predict which topic is linked to the textual data. With the aid of these models, we will be able to detect the emotion of users online. Further, these emotions can be used to analyze stress or depression. In conclusion, the ML models and a BERT model have a very good detection rate. This research is useful for the well-being of one's mental health. The results are evaluated using various metrics at the macro and micro levels and indicate that the trained model detects the status of emotions based on social interactions.",

        "abstract": "Sustainability is a major contemporary issue that affects everyone. Many companies now produce an annual sustainability report, mainly intended for their stakeholders and the public, enumerating their goals and degrees of achievement regarding sustainable development. Although sustainability reports are an important resource to understand a company\u2019s sustainability strategies and practices, the difficulty of extracting key information from dozens or hundreds of pages with sustainability and business jargon has highlighted the need for metrics to effectively measure the content of such reports. Accordingly, many researchers have attempted to analyze the concepts and messages from sustainability reports using various natural language processing (NLP) methods. In this study, we propose a novel approach that overcomes the shortcomings of previous studies. Using the sentence similarity method and sentiment analysis, the study clearly shows thematic practices and trends, as well as a significant difference in the balance of positive and negative information in the reports across companies. The results of sentiment analysis prove that the new approach of this study is very useful. It confirms that companies actively use the sustainability report to improve their positive image when they experience a crisis. It confirms that companies actively use the sustainability report to improve their positive image when they experience a crisis. The inferences gained from this method will not only help companies produce better reports that can be utilized effectively, but also provide researchers with ideas for further research.

        "abstract": "The image of the tolerant religion of Islam has been distorted by extremists in the last two decades in many ways, such as luring teenagers into terrorist acts. Nowadays, millions of users socialize and share ideas using social media platforms such as Twitter. Typically, the ideas shared on Twitter (tweets) reach and influence many people who could simply retweet them and make them even spread faster. Unfortunately, some of these ideas are posted by extremists who share hateful Arabic content. Thus, it is very important to automate the process of controlling and monitoring hateful Arabic tweets, given that Arabic is the most widely used language in the Islamic world. In this paper, we provide a manually labeled and curated dataset of 3,000 Arabic tweets that contain hateful and non-hateful tweets. To automate the process of detecting hateful tweets, we utilize advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques and perform sentiment analysis to capture the meaning of the Arabic words in a proper word embedding (Word2Vec). Also, we used the proposed model to classify and analyze 100,000 tweets of the last decade. The outcome of this work promotes future research on analyzing Arabic hateful speech by providing a manually labeled Arabic dataset, and the trained model (achieved 92% accuracy) which can be used as an underlying tool by governments, Internet service providers, and social media applications to detect any inflammatory tweets before they spread to a wider audience.",

Nowadays, several social media platforms are developed, among that twitter is a significant tool for sharing and acquiring peoples\u2019 opinions, emotions, views, and attitudes towards particular entities. This made sentiment analysis a fascinating process in the natural language processing (NLP) domain. Different techniques are developed for sentiment analysis, whereas there still exists a space for further enhancement in accuracy and system efficacy. An efficient and effective optimization based feature selection and deep learning based sentiment analysis is developed in the proposed architecture to fulfil it. In this work, the sentiment 140 dataset is used for analysing the performance of proposed gated attention recurrent network (GARN) architecture. Initially, the available dataset is pre-processed to clean and filter out the dataset. Then, a term weight-based feature extraction termed Log Term Frequency-based Modified Inverse Class Frequency (LTF-MICF) model is used to extract the sentiment-based features from the pre-processed data. In the third phase, a hybrid mutation-based white shark optimizer (HMWSO) is introduced for feature selection. Using the selected features, the sentiment classes, such as positive, negative, and neutral, are classified using the GARN architecture, which combines recurrent neural networks (RNN) and attention mechanisms. Finally, the performance analysis between the proposed and existing classifiers is performed. The evaluated performance metrics and the gained value for such metrics using the proposed GARN are accuracy 97.86%, precision 96.65%, recall 96.76% and f-measure 96.70%, respectively.",

They are constantly posting their level of negativity over the disaster situations at their location of interest. Understanding location-oriented sentiments about disaster situation is of prime importance for political leaders, and strategic decision-makers. To this end, we present a new fully automated algorithm based on artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP), for extraction of location-oriented public sentiments on global disaster situation. We designed the proposed system to obtain exhaustive knowledge and insights on social media feeds related to disaster in 110 languages through AI- and NLP-based sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), anomaly detection, regression, and Getis Ord Gi* algorithms. We deployed and tested this algorithm on live Twitter feeds from 28 September to 6 October 2021. Tweets with 67 515 entities in 39 different languages were processed during this period. Our novel algorithm extracted 9727 location entities with greater than 70% confidence from live Twitter feed and displayed the locations of possible disasters with disaster intelligence. The rates of average precision, recall, and $F_{1}$ -Score were measured to be 0.93, 0.88, and 0.90, respectively. Overall, the fully automated disaster monitoring solution demonstrated 97% accuracy.

We compare variations in polls (as a proxy of public opinion) with changes in the connotation of the news (sentiment) or in the agenda (topics) of a selected group of media outlets. Our results suggest that the sentiment content by itself is not enough to understand the differences in polls, but the combination of topics coverage and sentiment content provides an useful insight of the context in which public opinion varies.

This paper uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to explore a data set of 8,507 academic integrity papers published between 1904 and 2019. Two main techniques are used to linguistically examine paper titles: (1) bigram (word pair) analysis and (2) sentiment analysis. The analysis sees the three main bigrams used in paper titles as being \u201cacademic integrity\u201d (2.38%), \u201cacademic dishonesty\u201d (2.06%) and \u201cplagiarism detection\u201d (1.05%). When only highly cited papers are considered, negative integrity bigrams dominate positive integrity bigrams. For example, the 100 most cited academic integrity papers of all time are three times more likely to have \u201cacademic dishonesty\u201d included in their titles than \u201cacademic integrity\u201d. Similarly, sentiment analysis sees negative sentiment outperforming positive sentiment in the most cited papers. The history of academic integrity research is seen to place the field at a disadvantage due to negative portrayals of integrity. Despite this, analysis shows that change towards positive integrity is possible. The titles of papers by the ten most prolific academic integrity researchers are found to use positive terminology in more cases that not. This suggests an approach for emerging academic integrity researchers to model themselves after.",

However, the landscape of the financial domain presents extra challenges for NLP, due to the complexity of the texts and the use of specific terminology. Generalist language models tend to fall short in tasks specifically tailored for finance, even when using large language models (LLMs) with great natural language understanding and generative capabilities. This paper presents a study on LLM adaptation methods targeted at the financial domain and with high emphasis on financial sentiment analysis. To this purpose, two foundation models with less than 1.5B parameters have been adapted using a wide range of strategies. We show that through careful fine-tuning on both financial documents and instructions, these foundation models can be adapted to the target domain. Moreover, we observe that small LLMs have comparable performance to larger scale models, while being more efficient in terms of parameters and data. In addition to the models, we show how to generate artificial instructions through LLMs to augment the number of samples of the instruction dataset.",

Although delirium can be prevented and treated, it is difficult to identify and predict. Objective This study aimed to improve machine learning models that retrospectively identify the presence of delirium during hospital stays (eg, to measure the effectiveness of delirium prevention interventions) by using the natural language processing (NLP) technique of sentiment analysis (in this case a feature that identifies sentiment toward, or away from, a delirium diagnosis). Methods Using data from the General Medicine Inpatient Initiative, a Canadian hospital data and analytics network, a detailed manual review of medical records was conducted from nearly 4000 admissions at 6 Toronto area hospitals. Furthermore, 25.74% (994/3862) of the eligible hospital admissions were labeled as having delirium. Using the data set collected from this study, we developed machine learning models with, and without, the benefit of NLP methods applied to diagnostic imaging reports, and we asked the question \u201ccan NLP improve machine learning identification of delirium?\u201d Results Among the eligible 3862 hospital admissions, 994 (25.74%) admissions were labeled as having delirium. Identification and calibration of the models were satisfactory. The accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the main model with NLP in the independent testing data set were 0.807 and 0.930, respectively. The accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the main model without NLP in the independent testing data set were 0.811 and 0.869, respectively. Model performance was also found to be stable over the 5-year period used in the experiment, with identification for a likely future holdout test set being no worse than identification for retrospective holdout test sets. Conclusions Our machine learning model that included NLP (ie, sentiment analysis in medical image description text mining) produced valid identification of delirium with the sentiment analysis, providing significant additional benefit over the model without NLP.",

Concretely, we analyze 634 online comments reflecting attitudes towards healthcare services in different countries. Our analysis identifies the frequency of topics related to healthcare services in textual content of the comments and attempts to classify and rank national healthcare systems based on the respondents\u2019 sentiment scores. In this paper, we describe our approach, summarize our main findings, and compare them with the results from cross-national surveys. Finally, we outline the typical limitations inherent in the analysis of user-generated online content and suggest avenues for future research.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning techniques such as NLP (Natural language processing) play a key role in a context where mining social media data could add great value to governments of the world countries. The posts and tweets shared by the people on social media can be mined to infer the valuable \u2018mindset\u2019 of the people which is much required for any ruling government in the world. The objective of this study is to conduct sentiment analysis to mine the sentiment of the people regarding the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, using machine learning techniques. The idea is to analyze and infer if the countries have reacted in some way, considering the sentiment of their citizens, in the context of economic effects. The pipeline of the implementation associated starts with the data collection from social media such as Twitter and Reddit using Snscraper and the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper). The larger posts from Reddit are handled by implementing suitable text summarization techniques. Sentiment analysis is performed for the social media data using the BERT transformer model. The non-English posts are translated to English using neural machine translation. Also, sentiment analysis is performed at various granularities such as the location and the people that are tagged using Named Entity Recognition techniques. Finally, a comparative analysis of the world countries\u2019 sentiment and their corresponding reliance on Russian oil is performed.",

        "title": "Neuromorphic Sentiment Analysis Using Spiking Neural Networks",
        "abstract": "Over the past decade, the artificial neural networks domain has seen a considerable embracement of deep neural networks among many applications. However, deep neural networks are typically computationally complex and consume high power, hindering their applicability for resource-constrained applications, such as self-driving vehicles, drones, and robotics. Spiking neural networks, often employed to bridge the gap between machine learning and neuroscience fields, are considered a promising solution for resource-constrained applications. Since deploying spiking neural networks on traditional von-Newman architectures requires significant processing time and high power, typically, neuromorphic hardware is created to execute spiking neural networks. The objective of neuromorphic devices is to mimic the distinctive functionalities of the human brain in terms of energy efficiency, computational power, and robust learning. Furthermore, natural language processing, a machine learning technique, has been widely utilized to aid machines in comprehending human language. However, natural language processing techniques cannot also be deployed efficiently on traditional computing platforms. In this research work, we strive to enhance the natural language processing traits/abilities by harnessing and integrating the SNNs traits, as well as deploying the integrated solution on neuromorphic hardware, efficiently and effectively. To facilitate this endeavor, we propose a novel, unique, and efficient sentiment analysis model created using a large-scale SNN model on SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware that responds to user inputs. SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware typically can simulate large spiking neural networks in real time and consumes low power. We initially create an artificial neural networks model, and then train the model using an Internet Movie Database (IMDB) dataset. Next, the pre-trained artificial neural networks model is converted into our proposed spiking neural networks model, called a spiking sentiment analysis (SSA) model. Our SSA model using SpiNNaker, called SSA-SpiNNaker, is created in such a way to respond to user inputs with a positive or negative response. Our proposed SSA-SpiNNaker model achieves 100% accuracy and only consumes 3970 Joules of energy, while processing around 10,000 words and predicting a positive/negative review. Our experimental results and analysis demonstrate that by leveraging the parallel and distributed capabilities of SpiNNaker, our proposed SSA-SpiNNaker model achieves better performance compared to artificial neural networks models. Our investigation into existing works revealed that no similar models exist in the published literature, demonstrating the uniqueness of our proposed model. Our proposed work would offer a synergy between SNNs and NLP within the neuromorphic computing domain, in order to address many challenges in this domain, including computational complexity and power consumption. Our proposed model would not only enhance the capabilities of sentiment analysis but also contribute to the advancement of brain-inspired computing. Our proposed model could be utilized in other resource-constrained and low-power applications, such as robotics, autonomous, and smart systems.",

VADER is a lexicon-based method that uses a predefined set of guidelines to analyze the sentiment of a text, while Logistic Regression is a machine learning-based approach that relies on training data to learn how to classify the sentiment of a text. To evaluate the performance of these approaches, they were applied to a dataset of tweets about airlines and compared the results in terms of accuracy. The results showed that Logistic Regression outperformed VADER on this dataset, achieving an accuracy of 79%. These results suggest that Logistic Regression may be a more effective approach for sentiment analysis in the context of airline tweets.",

        "abstract": "The growth of the Internet has expanded the amount of data expressed by users across multiple platforms. The availability of these different worldviews and individuals\u2019 emotions empowers sentiment analysis. However, sentiment analysis becomes even more challenging due to a scarcity of standardized labeled data in the Bangla NLP domain. The majority of the existing Bangla research has relied on models of deep learning that significantly focus on context-independent word embeddings, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText, in which each word has a fixed representation irrespective of its context. Meanwhile, context-based pre-trained language models such as BERT have recently revolutionized the state of natural language processing. In this work, we utilized BERT\u2019s transfer learning ability to a deep integrated model CNN-BiLSTM for enhanced performance of decision-making in sentiment analysis. In addition, we also introduced the ability of transfer learning to classical machine learning algorithms for the performance comparison of CNN-BiLSTM. Additionally, we explore various word embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText, and compare their performance to the BERT transfer learning strategy. As a result, we have shown a state-of-the-art binary classification performance for Bangla sentiment analysis that significantly outperforms all embedding and algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis (SA) has been an active research subject in the domain of natural language processing due to its important functions in interpreting people\u2019s perspectives and drawing successful opinion-based judgments. On social media, Roman Urdu is one of the most extensively utilized dialects. Sentiment analysis of Roman Urdu is difficult due to its morphological complexities and varied dialects. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of various word embeddings for Roman Urdu and English dialects using the CNN-LSTM architecture with traditional machine learning classifiers. We introduce a novel deep learning architecture for Roman Urdu and English dialect SA based on two layers: LSTM for long-term dependency preservation and a one-layer CNN model for local feature extraction. To obtain the final classification, the feature maps learned by CNN and LSTM are fed to several machine learning classifiers. Various word embedding models support this concept. Extensive tests on four corpora show that the proposed model performs exceptionally well in Roman Urdu and English text sentiment classification, with an accuracy of 0.904, 0.841, 0.740, and 0.748 against MDPI, RUSA, RUSA-19, and UCL datasets, respectively. The results show that the SVM classifier and the Word2Vec CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) model are more beneficial options for Roman Urdu sentiment analysis, but that BERT word embedding, two-layer LSTM, and SVM as a classifier function are more suitable options for English language sentiment analysis. The suggested model outperforms existing well-known advanced models on relevant corpora, improving the accuracy by up to 5%.",

In-app messaging such as Telegram and WhatsApp, social media websites such as Instagram and Facebook, e-commerce websites like Amazon, Google searches, news publishing websites, and a variety of additional sources are the possible suppliers. Every instant, all these sources produce massive amounts of text data. The interpretation of such data can help business owners analyze the social outlook of their product, brand, or service and take necessary steps. The development of a consumer review summarization model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Long short-term memory (LSTM) to present summarized data and help businesses obtain substantial insights into their consumers' behavior and choices is the topic of this research. A hybrid approach for analyzing sentiments is presented in this paper. The process comprises pre-processing, feature extraction, and sentiment classification. Using NLP techniques, the pre-processing stage eliminates the undesirable data from input text reviews. For extracting the features effectively, a hybrid method comprising review-related features and aspect-related features has been introduced for constructing the distinctive hybrid feature vector corresponding to each review. The sentiment classification is performed using the deep learning classifier LSTM. We experimentally evaluated the proposed model using three different research datasets. The model achieves the average precision, average recall, and average F1-score of 94.46%, 91.63%, and 92.81%, respectively.",

By establishing experiment uses sentiment lexical terms to determine the grammatical relationship between\nsubject matter and sentiment lexicons.\nThe suggested approach outperforms the existing text sentiment analysis technologies, according to experimental data, because\ntweets' structure differs from that of conventional text. The categorization of emotions in textual data is known as sentiment\nanalysis, sometimes called opinion mining or emotion extraction. This approach has been widely used over time to pinpoint the\nfeelings and ideas present in a particular textual information set. People mostly use Twitter as a means of social media to\ncommunicate their feelings on specific events. In this study, we gathered tweets for different occurrences, evaluated them using\nseveral automated learning methods, including LSTM, the Random Forest classifier, SVM, and Na\u00efve Bays, and compared the\noutcomes.</jats:p>",

It is the automated process of identifying and classifying emotions in a text as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This way, companies can understand customers\u2019 sentiments, improve their products and services accordingly, and determine effective strategies. The need to discover the algorithm with the best classification performance is obvious. To this end, two different approaches for Sentiment Analysis problems are presented. The first one is based on Machine Learning (ML) models and the second one on Deep Learning (DP) models. Most ML models are flexible depending on their classifier hyperparameters and provide competitive accuracy levels but not all of them. Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forests (RF) of ML and the various models based on Neural Networks (NNs) of DL are applied. Useful results are obtained. Measures for classifiers\u2019 effectiveness are also provided.</jats:p>",

These reports can be unstructured with information presented in a variety of formats. The extraction of this information is frequently challenging, which limits its use in future projects. Natural language processing provides an efficient way of mining and obtaining knowledge. This paper demonstrates how these techniques were used to analyze vast amounts of historical documents to quickly rank well complexity and determine which aspects of drilling operations were most critical.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Sentiment analysis can be used to classify documents and other pieces of information into separate categories. In social media, it is used to analyze the collective perception of a given trending item. The technique was used here to classify wells into two ranked categorized lists. First, a classification listed wells by drilling issues. Second, a complexity ranking was defined so that each well could be classified as easy or difficult to drill. To build the sentiment analysis tool, a random set of training wells and their respective documents were selected. From these documents, a list of words was identified in what became known as highlighting sessions. During these sessions, subject matter experts (SMEs) classified words found in the documents. This \"bag of words\" was then used to train a classifier capable of ranking the wells related to the documents. A probability was associated to each well, providing a likelihood of inclusion in a given category.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The methodology proved to be successful, ranking drilling documents in both defined category sets. Results show that the list of ranked wells can be used by SMEs to identify which wells are relevant and deserve detailed analysis. The list generated for both categories provided a guideline for further analysis, particularly identifying wells with little value. Results also showed the importance of correctly developing a list of words, an adequate training set, and the language used, as well as the need for SMEs to produce the final analysis. The technology showed promising results with real-world applications being conceivable with its current level of maturity. However, the results also indicated room for improving its effectiveness by refining the highlighting sessions, word lists, types of classifier used, and final ranking methodology.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The use of methods and technology to help improve and enable the analysis of unstructured data in the drilling space should increase over time.

        "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The metaverse has become one of the most popular concepts of recent times. Companies and entrepreneurs are fiercely competing to invest and take part in this virtual world. Millions of people globally are anticipated to spend much of their time in the metaverse, regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, or culture. There are few comprehensive studies on the positive/negative sentiment and effect of the newly identified, but not well defined, metaverse concept that is already fast evolving the digital landscape. Thereby, this study aimed to better understand the metaverse concept, by, firstly, identifying the positive and negative sentiment characteristics and, secondly, by revealing the associations between the metaverse concept and other related concepts. To do so, this study used Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI) with computational qualitative analysis. The data comprised metaverse articles from 2021\u20132022 published on The Guardian website, a key global mainstream media outlet. To perform thematic content analysis of the qualitative data, this research used the Leximancer software, and the The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) from NLP libraries were used to identify sentiment. Further, an AI-based Monkeylearn API was used to make sectoral classifications of the main topics that emerged in the Leximancer analysis. The key themes which emerged in the Leximancer analysis, included \"metaverse\", \"Facebook\", \"games\" and \"platforms\". The sentiment analysis revealed that of all articles published in the period of 2021\u20132022 about the metaverse, 61% (n\u2009=\u2009622) were positive, 30% (n\u2009=\u2009311) were negative, and 9% (n\u2009=\u200990) were neutral. Positive discourses about the metaverse were found to concern key innovations that the virtual experiences brought to users and companies with the support of the technological infrastructure of blockchain, algorithms, NFTs, led by the gaming world. Negative discourse was found to evidence various problems (misinformation, harmful content, algorithms, data, and equipment) that occur during the use of Facebook and other social media platforms, and that individuals encountered harm in the metaverse or that the metaverse produces new problems. Monkeylearn findings revealed \u201cmarketing/advertising/PR\u201d role, \u201cRecreational\u201d business, \u201cScience &amp; Technology\u201d events as the key content topics. This study\u2019s contribution is twofold: first, it showcases a novel way to triangulate qualitative data analysis of large unstructured textual data as a method in exploring the metaverse concept; and second, the study reveals the characteristics of the metaverse as a concept, as well as its association with other related concepts. Given that the topic of the metaverse is new, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to do both.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract\n\nThere are many studies being conducted in the field of natural language processing related to sentiment analysis due to the growth of computer science and social media. However, there are many applications of sentiment analysis, and it might be difficult for researchers to review and understand past studies in order to see the trends. Thus, this study proposes trends for sentiment analysis research to assist sentiment analysis researchers. The data sources we obtained from our collections are Google Scholar and Scopus. Therefore, reviews of studies that are using multiple types of modalities have examined change from a particular event and from language itself have been researched more frequently in the last few years. Sentiment analysis is a powerful driver of natural language processing with huge implications for business, social media, healthcare, and disaster response, among others. In this review, we explore the complex landscape of sentiment analysis, its implications, challenges, and recent trends. We cover several important topics, such as the best dataset to use, the best algorithm to use, whether to consider different languages, and various new sentiment tasks. We evaluate the applicability of existing datasets (e.g., IMDB Movie Reviews, Twitter Sentiment Dataset) and deep learning approaches (e.g., BERT) to sentiment analysis. There has been progress in sentiment analysis, however, emerging challenges remain (e.g., sarcasm and irony, ethical challenges, and new domains). We believe sentiment analysis is dynamic in nature, so future research is necessary to capture the complexity of sentiment expression exhibited by humans, as well as to ensure ethical and effective use of sentiment analysis across specializations and languages.\n\nKeywords: - IMDB Movie Reviews, Twitter Sentiment Dataset, support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, social media, healthcare, and disaster response.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>The growing acceptance of social media networks as a platform to share opinions on several features emerged opinion mining or sentiment analysis (SA) as an active investigation part. In recent times, SA has attracted significant attention owing to its various applications in different features of our lives. SA is one of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) that purposes to analyze and process data that is transcribed in human languages. Even though the Arabic language is the most extensively spoken language utilized for content sharing through social media, the SA on Arabic content is restricted owing to numerous challenges with the language\u2019s morphologic structures, the dialect's variabilities, and the absence of the proper corpora. In recent times, deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) have demonstrated extraordinary achievements in the field of SA for Arabic tweet classification in social media platforms. In this manuscript, we design and develop an Integrated Deep Learning with Natural Language Processing Models for Sentiment Analysis and Classification (IDLNLPM-SAC) technique. The IDLNLPM-SAC model presents a sentiment analysis and classification using Arabic tweets. The presented IDLNLPM-SAC model follows different levels of data preprocessing to transform the raw Arabic tweet data into a compatible format. For the process of word embedding, the latent semantic analysis (LSA) technique can be deployed. Besides, the hybrid of parallel temporal convolutional network\u2013gated recurrent unit (PTCN-GRU) classifier can be implemented for the classification process. Eventually, the parameter choice of the PTCNGRU algorithm can be implemented by the design of the improved marine predator algorithm (IMPA). The simulation evaluation of the IDLNLPM-SAC technique takes place using the Arabic tweets database. The experimental results pointed out the heightened solution of the IDLNLPM-SAC technique compared to recent approaches.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, sentiment analysis, commonly referred to as opinion mining or emotional artificial intelligence (AI), is used to obtain student comments about institutional facilities. To ascertain whether an online text has a good, negative, or neutral emotional tone, it must first be analyzed. Natural Language Processing (NLP) includes the subfield of sentiment analysis, and NLP can be used to categorize and extract information with the aid of machine learning methods. Finding out if students are content with the amenities or services provided is important since, in an educational setting, they are consumers. This study of the resources and services that the libraries offer evaluated college students' perceptions of the books, audio CDs, and video CDs, the services provided by the library staff, and the personal computers that are made available to them as part of their facilities. In the current study, surveys were carried out to gather information and assess how well the needs of the students are addressed. On Kaggle.com, secondary data from a North Indian institution was used in the experiments. The research approach was sentiment analysis using a machine learning framework. The F1-score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall based on the attitudes evaluated by the algorithms, was calculated using a text-based classification method using Naive Bayes Multinomial and Support Vector machine learning algorithms. The findings offer views on how successfully library facilities are managed in the form of student sentiments.</jats:p>",
